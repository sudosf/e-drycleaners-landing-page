                <h3>5. Special Considerations</h3>
                <p><strong>Delicate or Vintage Items:</strong> For delicate fabrics, vintage items, or garments with a
                    value exceeding $500, we recommend our premium care service, which includes special handling and
                    additional insurance.</p>
                <p><strong>Alterations:</strong> Alterations are custom services. Once alterations have been completed,
                    refunds are limited to cases where the alteration does not match the specifications provided.</p>
                <p><strong>Missing Buttons or Accessories:</strong> Please note any missing buttons or accessories when
                    dropping off items. We cannot be responsible for accessories not specified at drop-off.</p>

                <p><strong>Rescheduling:</strong> You may reschedule pickups or deliveries at no charge if done at least
                    2 hours before the scheduled time. Last-minute rescheduling may incur a convenience fee.</p>

                <h3>7. Payment Method-Specific Policies</h3>
                <p><strong>Credit/Debit Cards:</strong> Refunds to credit or debit cards will be processed within 3-5
                    business days, though it may take your financial institution longer to reflect the refund in your
                    account.</p>
                <p><strong>In-App Credits:</strong> Refunds to in-app credits are typically processed within 24 hours
                    and may include a bonus amount as a courtesy.</p>
                <p><strong>Promotional Credits:</strong> Services paid for using promotional credits are generally not
                    eligible for cash refunds but may be refunded as in-app credits.</p>

                <h3>8. Bulk Order Refunds</h3>
                <p>For bulk orders (10+ items), partial refunds may be issued for specific items while the remainder of
                    the order is unaffected. The refund amount will be calculated based on the individual item prices
                    rather than the bulk discount rate.</p>

                <h3>9. Service Provider-Specific Policies</h3>
                <p>Each service provider on our platform may have additional policies regarding specific types of
                    garments or services. These provider-specific policies will be disclosed at the time of order
                    placement and will supplement this general refund policy.</p>

                <h3>10. Dispute Resolution</h3>

                <h3>11. Changes to Refund Policy</h3>
                <p>We reserve the right to modify this refund policy at any time. Changes will be effective when posted
                    on our platform. Your continued use of our services after such changes constitutes your acceptance
